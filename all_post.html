    <p class="mt-5 w-100 font--geist fs-5 "> As a student at Western Mindanao State University majoring in Computing Studies, I am fascinated by new technologies and tech trends. 
      Witnessing various inventions and advanced technologies during the tour was a unique experience. 
      Alongside my friends, who are also passionate about learning new concepts and ideas, we embarked 
      on a four-day tour that opened doors to significant opportunities as aspiring developers.</p>

    <p class="font--geist fs-5 mt-5">As we embarked on our journey to Subic, we were warmly greeted by our tour guide, Ms. Maria Suazo, who is also known as Ms. Lenz. 
      She led us to the Subic Bay Exhibition and Convention Center, a place brimming with history and artistic treasures. 
      Ms. Lenz provided us with a detailed tour, showcasing an array of artworks that highlighted the rich cultural heritage of the area. 
      She also shared fascinating stories and historical facts about Subic, giving us a deeper appreciation of its significance.
      Her insights and knowledge made the visit both educational and enjoyable, setting the tone for an enriching experience throughout our trip.
    </p>


    <div class="articleImage-2 mt-5 rounded-3"></div>
    <p class="font--geist fs-5 mt-5">The visit to the PAG-ASA Weather Station was highly informative as we learned about its primary role in weather forecasting. 
      We gained insights into weather patterns, structures, and the various hazards associated with them. Additionally, we learned about the key components
      involved in weather monitoring, such as wind signals and water levels. The experience provided us with a comprehensive understanding of 
      how weather data is collected and analyzed, and the importance of accurate weather monitoring in ensuring public safety.
    </p>

    <div class="articleImage-3 mt-5 rounded-3"></div>
    <p class="font--geist fs-5 mt-5">The FAA provided us with valuable insights into the functioning and maintenance of aircraft, as well as their coordination with 
      PAG-ASA for safe flights and precautionary measures. We learned about the crucial role of communication between these agencies in ensuring aviation safety.
       Additionally, we experienced the Red Bird technology simulator, which allows for the operation of an aircraft without real-world hazards. 
       This technology enabled us to understand the procedures for running both single-engine and multi-engine aircraft, offering a hands-on perspective of 
       piloting and aircraft management.
    </p>


    <div class="articleImage-4 mt-5 rounded-3"></div>
    <p class="font--geist fs-5 mt-5">The Vessel Traffic Management System was incredibly fascinating, as it tracks the movements of ships and other small vessels 
      crossing Subic Bay. The system is equipped with large monitors, metallic buoys, cameras, and a comprehensive radio system, but the most impressive technology 
      is the Automatic Identification System (AIS). All vessels must be equipped with AIS, which, with the aid of signal towers across the bay, allows for seamless 
      communication and precise tracking of each vessel. This technology ensures the safe and efficient management of maritime traffic, providing an essential service 
      to maintain order and safety in the bay.

      trains on the route from Antipolo to Santolan Station, which was a fun and enjoyable experience. Additionally, we were given access to their 
      main control room, where the railway system is monitored, providing us with a behind-the-scenes look at their operations. The train yard was 
      equally impressive, as we witnessed the meticulous maintenance of the trains and the railway system. This visit gave us a deeper appreciation 
      of the complexities involved in managing and maintaining a modern transit system.

    <p class="font--geist fs-5 mt-5">The National Museum of the Philippines provided a captivating narrative of how artists created their masterpieces. 
      We had the privilege of learning about Juan Luna's iconic artwork, "The Spoliarium." The museum's exhibition not only showcased the finished masterpiece
      but also delved into the creative process behind it. We gained insight into Luna's techniques, inspirations, and the historical context that influenced 
      his work. This experience deepened our appreciation for Filipino artistry and history, offering a profound glimpse into the artistic genius of one of the 
      country's most renowned painters.
